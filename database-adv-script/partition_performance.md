# Objective: Implement table partitioning to optimize queries on large datasets.

## Instructions:

    Assume the Booking table is large and query performance is slow. Implement partitioning on the Booking table based on the start_date column. Save the query in a file partitioning.sql

    Test the performance of queries on the partitioned table (e.g., fetching bookings by date range).

    Write a brief report on the improvements you observed.
